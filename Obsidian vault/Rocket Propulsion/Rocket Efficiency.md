# Efficiency
- Specific impulse 
	1. $\propto$ total impulse $\propto$ thrust
	2. $\propto$ effective velocity  
	3. !$\propto$ mass flow 
	> $$\begin{align*}I_{s}&= \frac{\int_{0}^{t}Fdt}{g_0\int_{0}^{t}\dot mdt}\\ &= \frac{I_t}{m_pg_0}\\ &= \frac{F}{\dot mg_0}\\ &= \frac{c}{g_{0}} \end{align*}$$
	- Analogous to miles-per-gallon (MPG)
		> [!Efficiency is not everything] 
		==High $I_s$ does not mean the rocket will go faster.== TWR ^[thrust to weight ratio] is what dictates how fast the rocket will accelerate. That's why we use RP-1 for first stage instead of $LH_2$

	- Define TWR based on velocity required for rocket to fully develop $C_p$ (Center of pressure)
	- Energy per mass vs energy per volume
	-  Optimum expansion ratio #CND
		-  where $\frac{A_e}{A_t}|p_e=p_a$ 
		-  you choose the altitude to optimize
