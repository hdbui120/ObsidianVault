Hello Professor Zadeh, 

It is me (Hieu) again with more questions, and I hope you have a good summer so far. I recently learn about multiplexer (I want to increase the number of analog channels on a microcontroller board we would use to collet data), and I would like to ask you about sampling rate. Normally, the sampling rate would be limited by the clock-speed of the controller chip if we just use the given pins from the manufacturer. However, if we use a multiplexer, the multiplexer IC switches between different inputs (sensors in my case) and relay the inputs one-by-one back to the microcontroller (from what I know so far). In that case, is the multiplexer dictates the sampling rate rather than the controller chip (assuming there is no bottleneck between the multiplexer and the chip)?
