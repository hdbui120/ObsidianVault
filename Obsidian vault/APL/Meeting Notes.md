- Database decision? csv or excel
- Go?
- Power
	- Voltage regulator
- Breakout board for DMA?
- Built loop under 600 operations
- every 64 sensors reading for a udp packet
- mathy documentation?
- 1 for writing 1 for reading
	- 1 for reading and 1 for hardware control (DMA?)
- everything in main loop
- Note to self: 
	- we need to discuss about data rate and limitations
	- clearer purpose of dma
	- what core does what
- ### Announcement for discord
	- Ben and Omar: database selection/handling, GUI design, UDP connection, format binary readings to udp packet.
	- Daniel: component selection and design for power distribution. (3.3V,5V,10V,24V)
	- Alex: Code layout (pinmode style instead of DDRD for now). SPI coms and hardware control.
	- Hernandez: PCBs for adcs and teensy. DMA
	- Hieu: finalize on hardware
	- Summary: we discuss about database and decide to try out alternatives.  We will continue with Flutter for UI design (dart for frontend; Go for backend?). Briefly go over data rate and packet rate (need more rigorous calculations for documentation). Talked about how to approach programming the teensy (polling/interrupt and style of coding).
