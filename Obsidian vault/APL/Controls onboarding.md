# Overall system architechture
Sensors -> filter -> OPAMP -> ADC -> MCU -> PC
- Sensors
	- RTD:
		- good accuracy, linearity, rugged, electrical noise immunity
		- bad response time
		- susceptible to vibration
		- Low operational range
		- expensive
	- Thermocouple (TC)
		- higher temperature range
		- long term stability not too good -> need recalibration more often
		- does not require power/excitation
			- vibration resistant
		- cheap
	- Thermistor
		- narrow ranges (as long as it's within the operational range issa gucci)
		- fast response
		- good accuracy
- Signal conditioning (analog)
	- filters for noises
	- OPAMP for span matching
- ADC
	- external
		- on chip adc are susceptible to noise due to being on the same die with other components (common-mode-noise)
		- flexibility of sensor placement (we want analog signal lines to be as short as possible due to signal degradation over long distance)
			- Allow better physical isolation for mcu system
		- potential for simultaneous samplings
		- Offer differential inputs (more accurate)
		- bit depth is more guaranteed on external ones
		- some external adcs might already have integrated pga
		- *include the maths here*
- MCU
	- Teensy
		- fastest clock
		- mainstream and easy to use (similar to arduino software wise)
		- 3 SPI instances
		- 100mb ethernet
		- ready to go development board package
		- usb is actually will be faster but signal degradation is bad > 2m
	- STM32 (H7)
		- dual cores = separation of concerns
		- more optimized
		- more efficient
		- fast
		- versatile when it comes to peripherals
		- good resume builder/skills/learning experience as industries use them extensively
		- more customizable when you wanna do your own custom pcb from scratch
		- ethernet
		- steep learning curve
			- configure the clock your self
			- set up registers yourself
			- etc.
		- development is going to take time
		- official documents is good
	- It's worth mentioning that there are profession DAQ devices/packages out there already. However, they are very expensive and proprietary. They are super convenient and just work but no learning experience and costly. 
	- A balance between performance/development time/cost/learning experience
	- Everything else are cheaper but slower or lack peripheral supports and not that significantly cheaper than stm32h7 or teensy.
- Front end
	- data shift out through rj45 with a-udp to display on PC
	- Data visualization with Flutter
	- Store to Redis (nosql)
- Concerns:
	- preparing data packets before shifting out  (memory, dma, ??)
	- Data synchronization? (already helpful with a fast sampling adc and chip as the time delay between samples are super small)
	- Programming structures (do we wanna do OOP? what need to be included? etc. )
	- Devising experiments
		- what to test?
		- how to test?
		- equipments needed?
	- Do you still need op amp (or adjust pga gain if it's built-in) for a differential inputs adc?
	- Noise?
