- [ ] timeline
	- Summer -> first half of fall quarter:
		- complete arduino mock up system
		- get familiar with the team and work flow
		- have alogorithms/code for calibration and process data from different sensors (Steinhart)
		- Nothing clearer for now as, hopefully, we'll learn more about things and be flexible to changes. 
- [ ] get a list of available DAQ options
	- [ ] budget
- [ ] get familiar with components
	- [ ] pressure transducer, temperature sensor, load cell, pdp, voltage regulator, etc.
		- [ ] sizing, and first principles
	- [ ] scuff setup with arduino
		- [ ] calibration
		- [ ] circuit~wiring diagram
		- [ ] read from sensors
		- [ ] transfer data to host pc
		- [ ] analyze/process the data (matlab or python or else)
		- [ ] Display on GUI
		- [ ] Perform some hardware control via GUI
			- [ ] hardware status (on/off/turn position/etc.)
		- [ ] Safety setup
- [ ] Software libraries to use
- [ ] Documentations and tasks delegation
	- Keep track of what you accomplish on GDrive
	- Tasks will be up on notions
	- We will share our work during meeting and discuss.  
- [ ] sensors mounting schemes
- [ ] interpreting data and come up with operating protocols
- [ ] Design GUI

Main objective: We want to control the flow of fluids with hardware as well as gather and process data from sensors. All of which should be done in a simple robust manner.

Arduino project:
	- ==controllable shooting tower==
	- Pan-tilt mechanism
	- shooting mechanism similar to football launching machine
	- control movement through computer 
		- send motor encoder data to host pc
		- PID for fixed angle
	- tennis ball
