- paper town - paper people - 2D character -> you don't know them until you get up close, talking, asking questions.
- Seeing people as just humans no more no less. What we imagine about people tell us more about who we are than who they are. However, seeing people as people is hard (Quentin parents arguing about politice).
	- everyone is different and will choose a different metaphors; IE: individual has different lenses. 
- Roots - strings - vessels (the metaphors in the book)
	- roots: optimistic, interconnected and strong. We live through and for each other
	- Strings: fragile, tension, painful
	- vessels: whole, cracks
		- craks let light through, thus you'll see what's inside -> vulnerabilities are cracks
		- You can treat the cracks, or you can let the ship sink
- Reminds me of [['This is Water']]^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC7xzavzEKY&t=28s] by Davis Foster Wallace. 
	- Same vein of thinking about people as people.

Paper Towns by John Green: 

The story revolves around a high school boy name Quentin Jacobsen (aptly called Q) obsessing over his childhood neighbor/friend/crush Margo Spiegelman. In Q's eyes, Margo is out of his league: gorgeous, smart, mysterious, fearless, exciting, etc. She IS the center of the universe, and the universe is right with her around. One day, she disappears into the wind. Q thinks it's his job to find her because she leaves him clues (again, because she's mysterious, amazing, and exciting). Subsequently, he and his group of friends go on a journey to follow Margo's heat signals. When they finally find her, it turns out that Margo did not want to be found. She just leave things behind for Q as a goodbye gifts. She was far from perfect. She was broken and tired of the '2D paper town she grew up in with its paper characters'. 

The book reminds me of 'This is Water' by David Foster Wallace. It's a long the line of we never really see people as people - no more no less. We are inherently self-centered, everything around us is our own perception; in the book (near the end), Q mentions about people see different metaphors, and how you choose to perceive/construct other peoples tells more about you than the other person. In additions, the three metaphors through out the book include: grass system, strings, vessels. If you see people as an interconnected grass roots, that mean you are hopeful and optimistic (we live through, with, and for each other). Or if you see people as strings, then we are fragile, insignificant, and easy to break with tensions. If we are vessels, then we are strong; however, we will have cracks. You can choose to fix the cracks by realizing the light is shining through or let it sink. In order for true empathy to happen, you have to probe, ask, talk, and listen with vulnerabilities and honesty, which requires a lot of meta-cognition. (This is a sad note, but David Foster Wallace killed himself over this because self-reflection and being nice in the face of shittyness around you is hard apparently). I digress. It doesn't get exciting to read until the latter half of the book though. Those are my 2 cents of the book - 7.5/10
