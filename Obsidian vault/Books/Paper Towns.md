- paper town - paper people - 2D character -> you don't know them until you get up close, talking, asking questions.
- Seeing people as just humans no more no less. What we imagine about people tell us more about who we are than who they are. However, seeing people as people is hard (Quentin parents arguing about politice).
	- everyone is different and will choose a different metaphors; IE: individual has different lenses. 
- Roots - strings - vessels (the metaphors in the book)
	- roots: optimistic, interconnected and strong. We live through and for each other
	- Strings: fragile, tension, painful
	- vessels: whole, cracks
		- craks let light through, thus you'll see what's inside -> vulnerabilities are cracks
		- You can treat the cracks, or you can let the ship sink
